				The Parallax Effect is a difference in the apparent position of an object when viewed along two different lines of sight. The Parallax it's measured by the semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.

				How to measure?
			</h2>

			<p>
				To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star from Earth, astronomers use the principle of parallax. Here, the term parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit. These distances form the lowest rung of what is called "the cosmic distance ladder", the first in a succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder.
